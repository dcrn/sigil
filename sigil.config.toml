# Test Implementation Conventions

All tests must use // Given, // When, and // Then comments to separate the \
three phases of each test:

- // Given  — set up the preconditions (temp dirs, contract files, server instances)
- // When   — perform the single action being tested (call the handler)
- // Then   — assert the expected outcome

Every test must have exactly one // When block. Setup and assertions must not \
be mixed into the same block. This makes it immediately clear what is being \
tested and what the expected result is.
